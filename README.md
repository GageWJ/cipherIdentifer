# cipherDetect
v1.3.0
A lightweight intelligence-style analyzer that detects and decodes common ciphers, classical cryptographic transforms, and encoded data.

CipherDetect is a Python based tool designed to quickly identify what kind of cipher, encoding, or transformation was applied to a given piece of text.
It automatically recognizes multiple formats, decodes what it can, and classifies the rest with high accuracy.

Perfect for CTFs, OSINT investigations, cryptography learners, and forensic analysts.
